<h4>Business Case Context</h4>
<p>My company aimed to offer the best prices in the FX market to increase its market share in Argentina. This initiative was closely aligned with the marketing team, which was spearheading a campaign with the slogan 'the best price in the market.'</p>

<p>To make this possible, the C-level executives tasked me with creating a sophisticated network of scrapers to monitor our competitors and ensure we delivered on our pricing claims. I developed 21 scrapers designed to track each competitor in the Argentine market. During development, I encountered challenges with two competitors that did not have public websites for scraping. To overcome this, I built a mobile emulator to run their applications on my server, enabling me to log in, navigate, and extract the necessary information.</p>

<p>All compiled information was shared with the entire company through a simple Flask website, providing a straightforward dashboard to monitor the market. This project is stored in <a data-fast-goal="click_on_repo_scrappers" href="https://github.com/fcucullu/scrapers-webdrivers"> this GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of these developments, my company successfully captured around 20% of the country's market share, marking one of my significant career achievements. This knowledge has also been applied to other RPA developments I have undertaken.</p>

<p>Note: This repo contains only files related to this specific objective and may lack the higher-level engine, as these resources were part of a larger software system I created. The purpose of this repo is not to provide a ready-to-use solution but to demonstrate my ability to build software relevant to its title.</p>
