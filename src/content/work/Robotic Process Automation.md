<h4>Business Case Context</h4>
<p>RPA was the entry point for my coding career. While I always understood the importance of comprehensive reporting, I was frustrated by the time required to complete these processes daily. I initially started automating tasks using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), eventually developing long and complex macros to process large and sensitive datasets.</p>

<p>However, these tools soon proved insufficient when I sought to combine the outcomes of multiple macros or automate the ETL processes involved. This led me to write Python scripts that, combined with scrapers and automated scheduling, transformed the entire reporting process into an automatic cycle of navigation, extraction, processing, transformation, and export, with even the triggering mechanism automated.</p>

<p>This resource was crucial, freeing my team from repetitive tasks and allowing them to focus on innovation and business intelligence projects that significantly improved my company's operations.</p>

<p>Note: This repo contains only files related to this specific objective and may lack the higher-level engine, as these resources were part of a larger software system I created. The purpose of this repo is not to provide a ready-to-use solution but to demonstrate my ability to build software relevant to its title.</p>
