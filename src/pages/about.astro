        <h2 class="section-title">My Story</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <strong data-fast-scroll="scroll_to_about_my_story_start">Recent Product Leadership</strong>
            <p>
            I work as an <strong>AI Product Consultant at IAG</strong>, helping enterprise clients integrate artificial intelligence into their digital transformation initiatives. I focus on translating complex AI/ML capabilities into viable product strategies, aligning innovation with market needs and business value.
            </p>
            <p>
            In our biggest client, I currently serve as <strong>Senior AI/ML Product Manager</strong>. I lead the development of one of the company’s flagship AI Suite products, designed to transform operational models and generate over $10M in annual savings. I’ve driven the transition of a legacy engineering team into a high-performing agile unit, balancing long-term product vision with fast, iterative delivery. I also represent the product internally, showcasing strategic direction across global conferences and leadership forums.
            </p>
            <p>
            Also, I serve as <strong>CPTO at The Pepino Brand</strong>, an early-stage MarTech startup. I rebuilt the product from the ground up to ensure scalability, while leading both product discovery and technical execution. My responsibilities span investor and client engagement, team leadership, and from architecture to delivery of our Brand Asset Management platform. 
            </p>

            <div style="height: 20px;"></div>

            <strong>Technology for Social Impact</strong>
            <p>
            One of the most meaningful chapters of my career was leading a cross-functional team of PhDs in partnership with <strong>UNICEF</strong> to develop an open-source crypto wallet for financial inclusion. The product was recognized globally as a <a href="https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/11545">Public Digital Good</a> and earned an <a href="https://www.corporatevision-news.com/winners/xcapit/">AI Innovation Award</a>. This experience deepened my commitment to purpose-driven technology, navigating complex governance and creating measurable social value.
            </p>
            <p>
            I’ve also collaborated in parallel with fintech startups, brokers, and AI research labs on process automation, optimization algorithms, and blockchain solutions — contributing to scalable architectures and product-driven experimentation.
            </p>

            <div style="height: 20px;"></div>

            <strong>Business Intelligence & Quantitative Trading</strong>
            <p>
            After moving beyond the performance management of the traditional banking sector, I entered the world of trading and data analytics. At <strong>Argentina’s largest retail broker</strong>, I performed as the lead quantitative trader and transitioned into a business intelligence leadership role. There, I built automation tools, internal dashboards, and a custom <a href="https://github.com/fcucullu/trading-fx">market-making algorithm</a> that enhanced stock liquidity and improved pricing strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
            I also collaborated across departments — including marketing and administration — to deploy machine learning models that improved customer segmentation, boosted conversion rates, and streamlined internal reporting processes.
            </p>

            <div style="height: 20px;"></div>

            <strong>Early Steps in Trading & Financial Systems</strong>
            <p>
            My first steps into the financial world were hands-on and fast-paced. I joined a leading corporate broker in the back office of its trading desk, gaining early exposure to portfolio management and financial modeling. Soon after, I moved into a more technical role that evolved into a dedicated BI position — a custom team created to maximize my technical and analytical strengths.
            </p>

            <div style="height: 20px;"></div>

            <strong data-fast-scroll="scroll_to_about_my_story_end">From the U.S. to Banking Foundations</strong>
            <p>
            My career began in the United States and later evolved at <strong>HSBC Bank</strong>, where I worked as a client relations specialist managing high-end investment products. This role sharpened my ability to understand customer needs and build trust — skills that would later become central to my product leadership style. I eventually joined HSBC’s Business Performance Management team, where I gained advanced knowledge of reporting systems, analytics, and <a href="https://github.com/fcucullu/RPA">process automation</a> — laying the groundwork for my journey into data, technology, and product innovation.
